git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/my-timetable.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 5. Deploy on Railway
1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Sign up with GitHub
3. Click "New Project"
4. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
5. Choose `my-timetable` repository
6. Railway will auto-deploy!

## Method 2: Using GitHub Desktop (Easier)

### 1. Install GitHub Desktop
- Download from: https://desktop.github.com/
- Sign in with your GitHub account

## After Deployment

### Add Database
1. In Railway project dashboard
2. Click "New" â†’ "Database" â†’ "Add PostgreSQL"
3. Database will be automatically connected

### Set Environment Variables
In Railway project â†’ Variables tab, add:
```
DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=my_timetable.settings_production
SECRET_KEY=make-this-a-long-random-string-50-characters
DEBUG=False
EMAIL_HOST_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=your-gmail-app-password
```

### Generate Secret Key
Run this in Python:
```python
import secrets
print(secrets.token_urlsafe(50))
```

## Your Live URL
Railway will give you a URL like:
`https://my-timetable-production.up.railway.app`

Share this with your friends! ðŸŽ‰

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Build fails**: Check logs in Railway dashboard
2. **Database errors**: Ensure PostgreSQL is added
3. **Static files missing**: Check if `collectstatic` runs in build
4. **Email not working**: Use Gmail app password, not regular password

### Getting Help:
- Check Railway logs in project dashboard
- Verify environment variables are set correctly
- Ensure all files are committed to Git

## What Your Friends Can Do:
- Register accounts
- Create faculties and subjects  
- Generate timetables
- Track attendance
- Manage lecture content

Enjoy your deployed timetable app! ðŸŽ“
